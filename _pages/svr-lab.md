# Space Vehicles and Robotics Lab (SVR)

The **Space Vehicles and Robotics (SVR) Lab** focuses on the modeling, estimation, and control of complex aerospace and robotic systems, with an emphasis on autonomy, resilience, and real-world applicability.  
Our work bridges theory and practice, combining rigorous analytical tools with simulation, software-in-the-loop, and experimental validation.

## Research Focus Areas

The SVR Lab conducts research in the following interconnected areas:

- **Spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control**
  - Attitude and orbit control
  - Relative motion and proximity operations
  - Multi-spacecraft and distributed systems

- **Adaptive and Learning-Based Control**
  - Adaptive control for uncertain and time-varying systems
  - Data-driven modeling and estimation
  - Integration of machine learning with control frameworks

- **Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR)**
  - Reaction wheel fault detection and health monitoring
  - Resilient control architectures
  - Safe autonomy under component degradation

- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**
  - Robotic motion planning and control
  - Estimation and perception-driven control
  - Cross-domain applications beyond aerospace

## Education and Student Involvement

The SVR Lab is strongly committed to student education and mentorship.  
Undergraduate and graduate students are actively involved in:

- Research projects tied to real-world aerospace problems
- Development of simulation and testing frameworks
- Senior design and independent study projects
- Conference and journal publications

Students gain experience in **control theory, numerical methods, simulation, and software development**, preparing them for both academic and industry careers.
